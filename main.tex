\begin{abstract}
  We introduce Cartesian Reachability Logic (CRL):
  a language-parametric logic for reasoning about k-safety hyperproperties.

  In recent years, formal verification of hyperproperties has become an important topic
  in the formal methods community.
  An interesting class of hyperproperties is known as $k$-safety:
  a $k$-safety property prohibits the existence of a \emph{bad} $k$-tuple of execution traces.
  Many security policies, such as \emph{noninterference}, 
  and functional properties, such as \emph{commutativity}, are $k$-safety.
  Previously, Cartesian Hoare logic (CHL) has been used for reasoning about $k$-safety hyperproperties
  of software systems.
  CHL has a sound and complete proof system and a performant verification algorithm.
  However, CHL targets only a specific, tiny imperative language, and to use it for sound verification
  of programs in a different language $L$, one needs to extend it with the desired features,
  or to hand-craft a translation.
  Both these approaches require a lot of tedious, error-prone work.
  An even worse alternative is to manually implement the verification algorithm,
  designed to work with the tiny language, with ad-hoc modifications targeting $L$:
  that gives the user of the implementation no guarantee at all.

  In contrast, CRL is language-parametric: it can be instantiated with any deterministic language
  modeled in a particular operational semantics formalism.
  Its soundness theorem is proved once and for all, with no need to adapt or re-prove it
  for different languages or their variants.
  Therefore, this powerful instrument can significantly reduce the development costs of tools and techniques
  for sound $k$-safety verification.

%   In recent years, formal verification of hyperproperties has become an important topic
%   in the formal methods community.
%   An interesting class of hyperproperties is known as $k$-safety:
%   a $k$-safety property prohibits the existence of a \emph{bad} $k$-tuple of execution traces.
%   Many security policies, such as \emph{noninterference}, 
%   and functional properties, such as \emph{commutativity}, are $k$-safety.
  
%   One logic for reasoning about $k$-safety hyperproperties of software
%   is Cartesian Hoare logic (CHL).
%   CHL has a sound and complete proof system and a performant verification algorithm.
%   However, CHL targets only a specific, tiny imperative language, and to use it for sound verification
%   of programs in a different language $L$, one needs to either extend it with the desired features,
%   or to hand-craft a translation. Both these approaches require a lot of tedious, error-prone work.
%   An even worse alternative is to manually implement the verification algorithm,
%   designed to work with the tiny language, with ad-hoc modifications targeting $L$:
%   that gives the user of the implementation no guarantee at all.
  
%   Therefore we introduce Cartesian Reachability logic (CRL): a new program logic for reasoning
%   about $k$-safety hyperproperties.
%   The distinguishing feature of CRL is that it can be instantiated with any deterministic language
%   whose model can be specified in a particular "operational semantics"-like formalism.
%   Its soundness theorem is proved once and for all, with no need to adapt or re-prove it
%   for different languages or their variants.
%   This powerful instrument can significantly reduce the development costs of tools and techniques
%   for sound $k$-safety verification.

%  Crafting a program logic targeting a specific language can be a challenging and time-consuming task.
%  In this paper we introduce a program logic for reasoning about $k$-safety hyperproperties,
%  with the distinguishing feature that our logic works with any deterministic language
%  that has a Reachability logic-based formal semantics.
%  This powerful instrument can significantly reduce development costs of tools and techniques for k-safety verification.
