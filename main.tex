\begin{abstract}
  In recent years, formal verification of software hyperproperties became an important topic in the
  formal methods community.
  An interesting class of hyperproperties is known as $k$-safety: a $k$-safety property prohibits
  existence of a \emph{bad} $k$-tuple of execution traces.
  Many security policies, such as \emph{noninterference}, and functional properties, such as \emph{commutativity},
  are $k$-safety.

  One logic for reasoning about $k$-safety hyperproperties of programs is Cartesian Hoare logic (CHL).
  CHL has a sound and complete proof system and a performant verification algorithm.
  However, CHL targets only a specific, tiny imperative language, and in order to use it for sound verification
  of programs in a different language $L$, one needs to either extend it with the desired features,
  or to hand-craft a translation.
  Both these approaches require lot of tedious, error-prone work.
  An even worse alternative is to manually implement the verification algorithm,
  which has been designed to work with the tiny language,
  with ad-hoc modifications targeting $L$: that gives the user of the implementation no guarantess at all.

  Therefore we introduce Cartesian Reachability logic (CRL): a new program logic for reasoning
  about $k$-safety hyperproperties.
  The distinguishing feature of CRL is that it can be instiantiated
  with any deterministic language
  that has a Reachability logic-based formal semantics.
  Its soundness theorem is proved once and for all, with no need to adapt or re-prove it for different
  languages or their variants.
  This powerful instrument can significantly reduce development costs of tools and techniques for
  sound k-safety verification.
